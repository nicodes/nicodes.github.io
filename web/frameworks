# My Favorite Frameworks

When starting a project, ask yourself one question: is this a purely serverside project, or is this a downloadable app (iOS, Android, PWA)? This decision significantly impacts the framework stack.

## üåê Web Only (Server-Side)

### Astro + Qwik

- [Astro + Qwik Integration](https://qwik.dev/docs/integrations/astro/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Qwik](https://qwik.dev/)

**Astro** excels at building fast, content-focused websites with a component-driven approach that seamlessly integrates with various frontend frameworks.

**Qwik** offers a unique approach to interactivity through resumable execution, ensuring blazing-fast load times by minimizing JavaScript overhead.

**Qwik** employs a unique approach known as "resumability," meaning your app loads instantly with near-zero JavaScript. It serializes the application's state during build time, minimizing client-side processing on initial load. JavaScript loads incrementally, only when necessary upon user interaction, dramatically improving initial load times and responsiveness.

**Astro** and **Qwik** combine strengths by maintaining minimal JavaScript overhead at page load. Astro generates static HTML and selectively hydrates components through Qwik's resumability. This combination guarantees exceptional SEO and lightning-fast initial page loads, offering optimal performance without compromising interactive capabilities.

**Capacitor** bridges web applications to native mobile environments, allowing you to create cross-platform apps efficiently.

## üéñÔ∏è Honorable Mention

### Solid Start

- [Solid Start](https://start.solidjs.com/)

**Solid Start** deserves recognition as an excellent metaframework for SolidJS. It helps streamline development when creating supplementary websites or resources alongside your SolidJS + Capacitor apps. Solid Start allows you to effortlessly reuse Solid components across platforms, resulting in a consistent and cohesive user experience.
